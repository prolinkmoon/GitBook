# Learning Center

This guide is made for anyone who wants to run a crypto node or validator — either on testnet or mainnet.

You don't need to be a Linux expert. We’ll start from the basics and go step by step. You’ll learn how to use Ubuntu, install the needed tools, run a node in the background, check logs, and keep your setup secure.

Many blockchain projects (like Cosmos-based chains, Ethereum rollups, or Substrate networks) use similar setups. So the skills you learn here can be reused across different chains.

Everything in this guide is written as simply as possible, with real commands that you can copy and run.
