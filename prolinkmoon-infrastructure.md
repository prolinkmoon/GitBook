# Prolinkmoon Infrastructure

Prolinkmoon - professional DevOps ready/standby for manage and monitoring infra 24/7. We rely on scripts, so that make it easy and everything runs automatically, but not forgetting security and reliability. &#x20;

For now we operate just some Node and Validator (5-15 network) and focus on what we have. Our target is to operate the Top 1-60 Cosmos Ecosystem and several other L1/L2 networks.

## Cosmos Ecosystem

Every single Network we run 3 node, Validator, Relay, and back-up +(TMKSM for high availability key).&#x20;
